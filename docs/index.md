#### Reflexion
The project went smoothly from the point on where I decided to ditch TornadoFX (JavaFX) in
favor of a GUI system I'm more comfortable with, that being HTML/CSS. The main problem that
occurred was that I became sick in the last few days before the deadline which led to me not
really being able to work on the project. As a consequence, only the documentation and design
for the planned application are done, but neither the documentation nor the design for the
actually implemented application. That being said, I'm very happy with how the application
turned out. I probably lost some points when it comes to the technologies I used and the separation of
concerns that these allow/support/recommend however I think the end result turned out better
overall then if I stuck to what would've given me the most points. I can at least say I'm proud of
my work and I'm happy that I could implement pretty much all features that I planned on
implementing.
